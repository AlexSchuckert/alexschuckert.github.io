## About Me

I am a quantum scientist exploring ways to use quantum computers for scientific discovery in material science, quantum chemistry, and nuclear physics.

## Research Interest: Quantum Simulation

- **Hardware-efficient digital quantum simulation using native particles:** Can we more efficiently simulate interacting systems consisting of the two fundamental particles in Nature - bosons and fermions - by using quantum computers built from bosons and fermions (in addition to qubits)?
- **Near-term fault-tolerant quantum computation:** Can we solve non-trivial problems with a small fault-tolerant quantum computer? 
- **Thermal observables and transport:** Can we find efficient ways to prepare low (but finite) temperature states and then measure transport observables? Does this enable us to solve problems using quantum computers that we couldn't solve using classical computers in condensed-matter physics, material science and quantum chemistry?

## News
- **[Jan. 2025]** Our paper on the first observation of a finite-energy phase transition in 1D has appeared in [Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02751-2). The New Scientist wrote a great [popular-scientific summary](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2464444-elusive-phase-change-finally-spotted-in-a-quantum-simulator/) of our results and their implications for future work. 
- **[Nov. 2024]** Our preprint on fermion-qubit error correction has appeared [on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08955).
