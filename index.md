## About Me

I am a scientist developing quantum computing methods for scientific discovery in material science, quantum chemistry, and nuclear physics.

## Research Interest: Quantum Simulation

- **Hardware-efficient digital quantum simulation using native particles:** Can we more efficiently simulate interacting systems consisting of the two fundamental particles in Nature - bosons and fermions - by using quantum computers built from bosons and fermions (in addition to qubits)?
- **Near-term fault-tolerant quantum computation:** Can we solve non-trivial problems with a small fault-tolerant quantum computer (1000-10000 physical qubits)? 
- **Thermal observables and transport:** Can we find efficient ways to prepare low (but finite) temperature states and then measure transport observables? Does this enable us to solve problems using quantum computers that we couldn't solve using classical computers in condensed-matter physics, material science and quantum chemistry?

## News
- **[Jan. 2025]** The [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2464444-elusive-phase-change-finally-spotted-in-a-quantum-simulator/) wrote a great summary of our 1D finite-energy phase transition [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02751-2) and its implications for future work. 
- **[Jan. 2025]** Our paper on the first observation of a finite-energy phase transition in 1D has appeared in [Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02751-2). A big thanks to Or Katz and Chris Monroe at Duke for the fun experiment-theory collaboration!
- **[Nov. 2024]** In our [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08955) on fermion-qubit fault-tolerance, we show how to encode a fermionic logical operator into fermionic atoms, and how fault-tolerant logical gates can be applied. This could potentially lower the resource requirements for simulation of quantum chemistry and material science by orders of magnitude!
