## About Me

I am a quantum scientist exploring ways to use quantum computers for scientific discovery in material science, quantum chemistry, and nuclear physics.

## Research Interest: Quantum Simulation

- **Quantum Computation using native particles:** Can we more efficiently simulate interacting systems consisting of the two fundamental particles in Nature - bosons and fermions - by using quantum computers built from bosons and fermions (in addition to qubits)?
- **Thermal State Preparation:** Can we find efficient ways to prepare low (but finite) temperature states? Does this enable us to solve problems using quantum computers that we couldn't solve using classical computers?
- **Near-term fault-tolerant quantum computation:** Can we solve non-trivial problems with a small fault-tolerant quantum computer? 

## News

- **[Nov. 2024]** Our preprint on fermion-qubit error correction has appeared [on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08955).
